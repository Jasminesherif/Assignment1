1. History of Computer Science 
 Mention 2 inventions that shaped modern computing 
1-Fortran: the first high level programming language developed in 1957 by 
IBM(International Business Machines Corporation) which allowed programmers 
to write codes in a more human readable way instead of machine code or 
assembly which were slow and error prone. It’s still used today in weather 
modeling and Aerospace. 
2-C: the first programming language to be used to write the code for an 
operating system (UNIX) developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie which made it 
possible for Oss to be developed in anything other than assembly or machine 
code. It also provided low level memory access despite being a high level 
language which makes it ideal for programming at system-level and application
level. 

 What is a compiler? Why do we need it? 
1-A program that changs from high level language to low level language (machine 
code) readable and executable by the machine. 
2-We need it to check for syntax errors and be able to run programs and codes. 



2. Academic vs Real-World Agile Work 
 List 3 key differences 
1-Academic work focuses on building knowledge while real-world agile work 
focuses on practical problem solving 
2-Academic work is mostly done individually while real-world agile work requires 
teamwork where each has an assigned role 
3-Academic work involves limited and controlled practical situations with no risks 
while real-world work involves dealing with real-life, messy and unpredictable 
situations that might includ taking risks 

 What are the typical steps in a sprint? (e.g. planning ? delivery ? retrospective) 
Sprint Planning ? Sprint Execution ? Daily Stand-ups ? delivery ? Sprint 
Review ? Sprint Retrospective ? Repeat 
1-Sprint planning:
- Identifies goals 
- Project owner views product backlog 
- Sprint backlog is created 
- Teams and tasks are assigned 
2-Sprig Execution: 
- each team goes to towards executing their tasks 
- involves development 
- development is followed by testing 
3-Daily Stand-ups: 
- Daily meetings were daily progress is discussed to make sure the project 
is going in the right direction 
4-Delivery: 
- At the end of each sprint a fully shippable and tested product should be 
ready 
5-Sprint Review: 
- Gathers feed-backs 
- updates product backlog 
6-Sprint Retrospective: 
- meeting for self-reflection between teammates 
- discusses what went wrong and right and what can we improve - enables learning from mistakes for handling the next sprint better and 
improving it
